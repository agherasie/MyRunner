    Some BADNIKS will try to stop you from reaching your goal!
    Jump on them to destroy them and release the innocent ANIMALS that are trapped within!
    Destroying a BADNIK will also increase your SCORE!
    If they touch you while you're defenseless, you will get hurt! Avoid this situation at all costs!
    Gather RINGS throughout the LEVELS in order to get protection.
    At the end of each LEVEL, your total SCORE will be increased by the number of RINGS you hold and the TIME you took to finish.
